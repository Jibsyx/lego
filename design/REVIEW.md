# Design Review

## Low-fidelity sketches
In the design dossier.

## List of taken considerations for sketches/design
-Clarity over style: I prioritized clear information (price, date, link) over visual complexity.
-Filter-first interface: Users can interact directly with dropdowns or sliders to manipulate data quickly.
-Minimal user distraction: The layout keeps everything in one column, reducing the need to scroll side-to-side or open modals
## Main problem we are solving for
Helping users quickly identify the best LEGO deals based on their own criteria like price, discount, comments, or popularity.
## Measures of the success
If users can easily:

-Sort or filter deals
-Understand deal quality through indicators
-Navigate and act on deals (e.g., open links)
## List of visual aspects convictions
-Layout: Vertical, column-based layout that keeps all controls visible at once
-Spacing: Padding and margins between elements like cards and dropdowns for readability
-Color choice: Neutral/light background for better readability, stars/icons in gold to stand out
-Font choice: Default system font for simplicity and speed, avoiding heavy web font usage
## List of interaction patterns convictions
-Dropdowns for sorting: Avoids overwhelming users with too many buttons
-Checkboxes for thresholds: Clear and easy to toggle (discounts, temperature, etc.)
-Star button for favorites: Immediate feedback, no need for confirmation popups
